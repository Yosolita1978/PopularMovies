## Project Overview
In this project, I'm grabbing information from an IMDB API with the more popular and top rated movies at the moment. You can save your favorites movies and see their information separated. 

## What did I Learn?
Through this project:
- Learn how to connect API to grabbing information
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Working with Room for connecting your DB and data persistence
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly with a Recycle Vew Adapter with a Grid

Hi! My name is Cristina Rodriguez and I am a software engineer. I received training from Hackbright Academy, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco (graduation: March 2017). I'm now a recipient of the 2018 Grow Scholarship from Google and Udacity for Android Basics. I used to work as a project manager in a software company and there I got interested in learning Python and being able to create my own software projects. I'm currently seeking a front-end developer role in the Greater Seattle Area. If you have a role that I should hear about, feel free to email yosola at gmail.
